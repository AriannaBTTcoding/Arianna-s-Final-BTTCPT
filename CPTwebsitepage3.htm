</P>
<P> 
<font color="black"> 
In one of the very first units we covered in my business course, 
we talked about ergonomics in the office. 
I learnt many useful things about how ergonomics affects the 
workplace and our focus. This artifact shows my knowledge of 
ergonomics and how it affects me. The meme exemplifies my 
understanding of temperature when it comes to ergonomics. 
My knowledge of ergonomics will help me later on in the world
 of business because I will be able to work comfortably. 
I would also be able to share my knowledge with co-workers. 
Being able to help others connects to the Catholic School 
Graduate Expectations of being an effective communicator and 
a caring family member.
