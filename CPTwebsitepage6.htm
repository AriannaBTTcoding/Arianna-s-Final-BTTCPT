This is my fourth artifact, it is a group presentation done by me and my classmates about video conferencing.
Specifically Facetime and it presents my understanding of apps and systems.

I enjoy doing presentations and it is another one of my 
strengths in this course. This presentation was a group effort 
but we all played our own roles in making it and Iâ€™m proud of 
how it turned out. It shows my skills in design and gathering 
information well. Both of those things are important in the 
world of business. I know that I will keep improving my skill 
in presentations but I do think it is one of my best skills 
learned from this course. This piece of work shows that I am a 
collaborative contributor and a responsible citizen.
