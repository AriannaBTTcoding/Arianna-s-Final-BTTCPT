<FONT SIZE=7> Artifact #7

This is my  seventh and last artifact, it is my favorite piece of work I have completed in my grade 9 business course.
It is a fully functional website made with Wix. It showcases my web design skills, creativity and how much effort 
I like to put into things.

During one of our last units in my grade 9 business class, 
we learned how to make a website using a template. It was a 
bit of a challenge to understand how to use this application 
but once I figured it out, I made a good website. 
This displays my skill in graphic design and creativity. 
It will help me later in my life if I ever need to make a 
website look really good. This makes me a reflective, 
creative and holistic thinker.
