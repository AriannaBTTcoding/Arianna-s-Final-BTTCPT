Back to my presentation skills, I think it is one of my 
strengths whether I’m working with a group or individually. 
I made this presentation on my own about a big topic that 
everyone should be educated on. I enjoy presenting to others 
and putting information together which makes me different 
from others. Most people don’t like presenting and teaching 
others so this skill of mine hopefully makes me stand out. 
Connecting this with the Catholic Graduate Expectations, 
it makes me a discerning believer and an effective communicator.
