This piece of work shows that I know how to properly format a 
business letter. This is a very important but simple skill to 
know for my future career. It doesn’t matter if I want a career 
in business or something else, it’s a great skill to have. 
In the real world, people will send letters often to 
communicate with coworkers and bosses. Knowing this basic skill 
makes me a great candidate for any job. This skill connects to 
the Catholic Graduate Expectations of being an effective 
communicator.
