Talking more about my spreadsheet skills, 
this specific piece of work showcases my skill in 
calculations and shortcuts in Excel or Google Sheets. 
I wonâ€™t lie, at the beginning of this unit I had trouble 
understanding the formulas and merging of cells, 
but I picked up and found that I was good at it. 
In this artifact, I used many different formulas and also 
merged cells to make it more presentable. 
Knowing all these formulas and techniques will help me 
later in life. Learning more and more about spreadsheets 
is a great way for me to keep developing my skills in this 
application. Wanting to continue to learn, makes me a 
discerning believer and a reflective, creative, and 
holistic thinker.
