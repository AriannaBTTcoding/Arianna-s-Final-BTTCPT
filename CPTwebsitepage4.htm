During my time in this class, 
I learned that one of my strengths was spreadsheets. 
Once I finally understood the shortcuts and how to work systems
 like Google Sheets and Excel, I enjoyed doing spreadsheets. 
It was one of my favorite units! 
I chose this specific spreadsheet because it showcases my skills
 in design. I used a template to make it look more presentable 
but also informative. Knowing how to design a spreadsheet will 
help me later in life because most jobs in business require 
skills in Excel and Google Sheets. 
This means that I am preparing myself for my future career. 
This skill connects to the Graduate Expectations of being a 
responsible citizen, a self-directed, responsible, 
lifelong learner.
